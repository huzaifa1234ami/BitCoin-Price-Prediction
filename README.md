Welcome to CRYPTOVIS, a project focused on predicting Bitcoin's closing prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project uses historical data from 2017â€“2022 to analyze patterns in financial indicators like Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, building reliable models for market trend analysis and investment insights.

The project employs Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Models implemented include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sequential data handling, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for time-series forecasting, and Random Forest Regressor for feature-based predictions.

The dataset contains attributes such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. Comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory analysis ensure high-quality inputs for the models. A Power BI dashboard further enhances understanding by comparing model metrics like accuracy, error rates, and prediction trends through interactive visualizations.
